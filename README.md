# 🛵 Shared E-Moped Usage Analysis (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

This is a capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), focusing on analyzing simulated usage data from a shared electric moped system in a Chinese city.

## 📌 Project Summary

- **Objective:** Identify user riding patterns to support decisions on fleet deployment, station optimization, and targeted marketing.
- **Tools Used:** R, Excel, Tableau, GitHub
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, business insight development

---

## 🔍 Key Business Questions

- What are the peak riding hours for different user types?
- Which start and end stations are used most frequently?
- What routes are most common among all users?
- Do casual and subscriber users ride differently?
- How does ride duration vary across days of the week?
